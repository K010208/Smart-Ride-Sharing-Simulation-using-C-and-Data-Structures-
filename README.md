# Smart Ride-Sharing Simulation using C++ and Data Structures

## 🚖 Project Overview
This project is a **C++ based Ride-Sharing Simulation** that demonstrates the use of **Data Structures and Algorithms** to allocate drivers efficiently to ride requests.  

It mimics real-world ride-hailing apps (like Uber/Ola) with simplified logic:
- Assign drivers based on **nearest distance**.
- Use **priority queues** for efficient driver allocation.
- Apply **surge pricing** when demand is high.
- Manage ride completion and availability.

This project was developed as part of a **Data Structures and Algorithms Internship Project**.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Driver allocation using **priority queue** (min-heap).  
- ✅ Calculates **distance** between driver and passenger.  
- ✅ Implements **surge pricing** if multiple ride requests exist.  
- ✅ Tracks ride completion and updates driver availability.  
- ✅ Demonstrates **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and **algorithmic thinking** in C++.
